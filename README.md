# SaloneMarket 🌾

**Automated crop price SMS alert service for Sierra Leone.**
Weekly price alerts sent directly to farmers' phones. No smartphone required.

---

## What this does

Every Monday at 7am, SaloneMarket:
1. Reads crop prices from your Google Sheet (populated by your market informants)
2. Formats a personalised 160-char SMS per subscriber showing prices for their chosen crops
3. Sends the SMS via Africa's Talking to every active/trial subscriber
4. Includes a "best market" tip (e.g. "Best: sell Rice in Freetown this week")

Farmers subscribe by dialling `*384*4321#` on any phone. Payment is collected via Orange Money or Afrimoney. No app, no internet, no smartphone needed.

## Setup (step by step)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/salonemarket.git
cd salonemarket
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Google Sheets setup

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project → Enable **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API**
3. Create a **Service Account** → download the JSON key file → save as `google_credentials.json`
4. Create a Google Sheet with these tabs:
   - `Subscribers` (columns: phone, name, district, crops, plan, status, joined_date, paid_until, association)
   - `Rice` (columns: date, market, price_nle, source)
   - `Cassava`, `PalmOil`, `Cocoa`, `Groundnut`, `Tomato` (same columns)
5. Share the sheet with the service account email (from the JSON file)
6. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL into `.env`

### 3. Africa's Talking setup

1. Sign up at [africastalking.com](https://africastalking.com)
2. Create an application → get your API key and username
3. Register a USSD code (e.g. `*384*4321#`) → set callback URL to `https://yourdomain.com/ussd`
4. Register a Sender ID `SaloneMarket` (requires AT approval, takes 1-3 days)
5. Add credentials to `.env`

### 4. Orange Money setup

1. Register as a merchant at [developer.orange.com](https://developer.orange.com)
2. Create an app → get Client ID, Client Secret, and Merchant Key
3. Set your notification URL to `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/orange-money`
4. Add credentials to `.env`

### 5. Run locally

```bash
# Start the web server
python app.py

# In another terminal, test the USSD flow manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ussd \
  -d "sessionId=test123&phoneNumber=+23276000001&text=&serviceCode=*384*4321#"

# Preview this week's blast (requires ADMIN_API_KEY in .env)
curl http://localhost:5000/admin/blast-preview \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yourkey"

# Trigger a manual blast
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/admin/trigger-blast \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: yourkey"
```

### 6. Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### 7. Deploy to Railway.app (free tier)

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

Set environment variables in the Railway dashboard (same as your `.env` file).
Railway will auto-detect the `railway.toml` and use gunicorn.

## Weekly data entry workflow

Every **Sunday evening** (or Monday before 7am), your market informants WhatsApp you prices.
You (or they, if you give them access) enter them into the Google Sheet:

| date       | market    | price_nle | source        |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-04-28 | bo        | 420       | Ibrahim Sesay |
| 2024-04-28 | freetown  | 460       | Fatmata Koroma|
| 2024-04-28 | kenema    | 410       | Alhaji Bangura|

The scheduler reads this at 7am Monday and builds the SMS automatically.

**Tip:** Create a simple Google Form that your informants can fill in on their phone.
Link it to the same Sheet. Zero data entry for you.
